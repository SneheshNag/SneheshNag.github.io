        <h4>In the review of The Seven Decisions of Gandhi, Town Topics, March 14, 2023</h4>
        <p>"The final “Salt March” movement took its name from the massive 240-mile march to the sea to protest a British tax on salt. The Indians who marched with Gandhi sang “Raghupati Raghava Raja Ram” and “Vaishnava Jana To,” both of which Harvey included in his joyous, celebratory finale built over Chatterjee’s bassline pulse. The thundering climax included a vigorous, enchanting duet with Nag on sitar." </br></br> – Courtney Smith, NJArts, 2023</p>
        <h4>In the review of The Seven Decisions of Gandhi, NJArts, March 15, 2023</h4>
        <p>"The closing movement in particular captured history with the use of hymns of the time, as Harvey and Chatterjee were joined by Snehesh Nag playing resonant and crystalline sitar lines." </br></br> – Nancy Plum, Town Topics 2023</p>
        <h4>Review of solo performances</h4>
        <p>"Earlier, Snehesh Nag–perhaps the youngest artiste of the event–commenced the event with a timely <em>Bhimpalasi</em> around 4 pm. The sweet tone of his tuneful sitar, dipped in an introspective mood, the <em>jod-jhala</em> segments displayed powerful <em>gamaks</em> and restive strokes building a crescendo before the medium-paced <em>rupak gat</em>. Its <em>aad-chhanda-gat</em> was spread over two seven-beat cycles of the <em>tala</em>. That led to <em>laya-chhanda</em>-based improvisations, which showed matured thinking. During the tabla solo-rounds, the intelligent sitar player remained glued to the latter half of the complex composition's refrain (seven beats). Their <em>teentaal</em> merrily danced with <em>taans</em> and <em>jhala</em> at high speed and culminated in a neat <em>tihai</em>." </br></br> – Meena Banerjee, The Telegraph, 2016</p>
        <!-- <h4>Review of solo performance at the Maitreyee , The Hindu, May 7, 2015</h4> -->
        <p>"Snehesh blended a lot of emotion, surprise elements, and aesthetic touches replete with dramatic ups and downs of several euphoric crescendos and lingering peace punctuated by well measured silences; all streaming out of a thinking mind, far too matured for his age." </br></br> – Meena Banerjee, The Hindu, 2015</p>
